<h1>TCP Chat</h1>

<p>Working with those HTTP helper classes might cover a lot of the bases, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what everyone wants to use to communicate. &nbsp;When you want to talk to someone over the internet, make sure the message gets there, and in order, then it&#39;s the job for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP</a> based sockets.</p>

<p><strong>Keep in mind that this is not a tutorial on how TCP works</strong>, just how to use C#&#39;s TCP APIs. &nbsp;If you are looking for one of those, <a href="http://ssfnet.org/Exchange/tcp/tcpTutorialNotes.html">this looks like a good place to start</a>. &nbsp;I&#39;d also recommend watching a few YouTube videos. &nbsp;You don&#39;t need to know the exact details of how TCP works, but it&#39;s a good idea to learn what goes on under the hood. &nbsp;</p>

<p>To start out simply, we are going to make a very simple chat program. &nbsp;I don&#39;t want to do your standard &quot;echo server,&quot; like many other tutorials do. &nbsp;If you want one of those <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/jmanning/2004/12/19/simple-tcpclient-echo-clientserver-example/">you can find one here</a>. &nbsp;<strong>This is a much more complex example of using TCP communications</strong>, but I think it should be easy to grasp.</p>

<p>There are two main ways of using TCP communications in C#:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Using a raw <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.sockets.socket(v=vs.110).aspx"><code>Socket</code></a> object</li>
	<li>Using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.sockets.tcpclient(v=vs.110).aspx"><code>TcpClient</code></a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.sockets.tcplistener(v=vs.110).aspx"><code>TcpListener</code></a> classes</li>
</ol>

<p>The former looks pretty close to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets">Berkeley/POSIX</a> socket API, whereas the latter is a handy wrapper around <code>Socket</code> objects that are using TCP (go figure by the name). &nbsp;Since I want to start things off lightly we will be using <code>TcpClient</code> and <code>TcpListener</code> for our TCP Chat program. &nbsp;Don&#39;t worry, if you&#39;re interested in <code>Socket</code>, we&#39;ll cover that later.</p>

<p>I also want to note that <strong>we will be using synchronous, single-threaded code for this project</strong>. &nbsp;In any real world application, you should be using <code>async</code> &amp; multi-threaded&nbsp;code when working with network operations. &nbsp;I want to keep things simple right now, and after this, I&#39;ll give you a multi-threaded example sometime later. &nbsp;The <code>async</code> methods of <code>TcpClient</code> and <code>TcpListener</code> should be easy to use if you know how to do <code>async</code> programming and know the non-async methods of these two classes.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>

<p>We&#39;re going to break the TCP Chat application into three chunks. &nbsp;A Server (to distribute messages), a Messenger (to post messages), a Viewer (to receive messages). &nbsp;If you&#39;re wondering why I&#39;m breaking this into three parts, it&#39;s because I don&#39;t want to have to deal with any GUI code. &nbsp;Since each part will be its own executable, make sure to add three separate Projects to your Solution. &nbsp;We&#39;ll do the Server first, the Messenger second, and the Viewer last.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="tangent">
<p>It drives me nuts when people write tutorials but make me use things that really aren&#39;t necessary to teach a concept. &nbsp;An example of this would be including GUI code in a tutorial that doesn&#39;t really need it; I&#39;ve seen this way too many times in other C# tutorials.</p>
</div>

<h3>Application Protocol</h3>

<p>For those of you who know their<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model"> OSI model</a>, we&#39;re going to define our Application Layer protocol now. &nbsp;If you don&#39;t know what that is, it&#39;s how our application will transmit data and interpret it. &nbsp;Note that we have two different types of clients (Messenger and Viewer), so the server needs to treat them different. &nbsp;We will only use plain text (no binary data), and it will all be in UTF-8 encoding.</p>

<p>Starting with the Viewer client:</p>

<ul>
	<li>After a Viewer establishes a connection with the Server, it will send the message:&nbsp;<code>viewer</code>. &nbsp;The server will then recognize that client as a Viewer.</li>
	<li>The Server will just send plain text messages to every Viewer client. &nbsp;The Viewer should just display what it has been told.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Messenger client:</p>

<ul>
	<li>After a Messenger establishes a connection with the Server, it will send the message <code>name:MY_NAME</code>, where <strong>MY_NAME</strong>&nbsp;is the name the messenger wants to use (e.g. <code>name:Kevin Bacon</code>). &nbsp;If the name is already taken by another Messenger client, the server should send the message <code>name taken</code> and disconnect the client.</li>
	<li>Though if the Messenger was successful in connection, the Server should just then listen in for any messages that are sent, and then distribute them to the Viewers.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This really isn&#39;t the most feature rich protocol design (and not the best), but it&#39;s a nice simple example. &nbsp;If you need some help figuring out the flow of things, take a look at the diagram below.</p>

<h2>A Note&nbsp;Before Starting</h2>

<p>There is a lot more code here than my other examples, but there is also a lot of redundancy between the three files. &nbsp;Don&#39;t get discouraged. &nbsp;Take a break if you need to. &nbsp;The Server and the Viewer have &quot;Ctrl-C,&quot; handlers FYI. &nbsp;There are many lines of code that have a comment next to them that tell you if a call blocks or not. &nbsp;Also, around most of the code there aren&#39;t any try-catch blocks like there should be in production code.</p>

<p>There is...&nbsp;<a href="http://www.badum-tish.com/"><em>one exception</em></a>. &nbsp;We&#39;re not sending any messages to the clients or server to notify that one might be disconnecting. Instead&nbsp;we just close the <code>TcpClient</code> and <code>NetworkStream</code> on whichever side wants to end the connection. &nbsp;This still will transmit FIN &amp; ACK TCP packets between both ends. &nbsp;We can use this code on a local end to check if those packets have been sent.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This code is found in all three files, so once you understand it, feel free to copy &amp; paste it.</p>

<p>In the Main functions for each file, I left commented out some command line argument parsing. &nbsp;It&#39;s not very complex (or the proper thing to do in production code), but it&#39;s there if you want to try to run the application without hard set values. &nbsp;Just make sure you get the arguments write when entering them or you&#39;ll get some errors.</p>
