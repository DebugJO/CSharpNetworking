<h1>IPAddress</h1>

<p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.ipaddress(v=vs.110).aspx"><code>IPAddress</code></a> is a very small class in the <code>System.Net</code> namespace. &nbsp;It&#39;s job is to just represent, well, an IP address. &nbsp;It supports both IPv4 and IPv6 type addresses.</p>

<p>You can make new IP address&nbsp;either by supplying a byte array to the constructor, or using the <code>IPAddress.Parse()</code> (or <code>IPAddress.TryParse()</code>) method to get one from a string. Exceptions will be thrown if the IP address is malformed (either via strings or byte arrays). &nbsp;<strong>When using the constructor, if you supply a byte array of exactly four bytes, it will assume you want an IPv4 address</strong>.</p>

<p>Please also note the static fields of <code>IPAddress</code> are very important when creating servers, all of them are read only.</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>Any</code> - This tells a <code>Socket</code> to listen for connections on any network devices. &nbsp;Which may be coming in locally or via a network</li>
	<li><code>Loopback</code> - This tells a <code>Socket</code> to listen for connections that are <strong>only</strong> coming in from the local machine (127.0.0.1)</li>
	<li><code>Broadcast</code> - This provides the broadcast IP address to a socket</li>
	<li><code>None</code> - This tells a <code>Socket</code> not to listen in for any connections</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the fields above are for IPv4, but <code>IPAddress</code> has IPv6 versions of most of these static fields.</p>
